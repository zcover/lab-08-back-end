# City-Explorer
## Overview
This is backend for a frontend application designed to allow users to access weather for the location that is asked for. This backend accesses JSON data stored locally to be supplied to the frontend in a readable format

## Getting Started
### If you build from scratch, you will have to install the following packages:
1. npm init -y
2. npm install -S express dotenv
3. npm install -S cors
4. npm install -S superagent (for working with APIs)

### If you copy the code down to your machine from my repo, simply:
1. type npm install (to install all packages needed)
2. Do a touch .env to create a file, then within that .env file add:
* add PORT=port_number
* Add an environment variable to your server named `EVENTBRITE_API_KEY` ,
* Add an environment variable to your server named `WEATHER_API_KEY`, and use it appropriately in your code.
* Add an environment variable to your server named `GEOCODE_API_KEY` , and use it appropriately in your code.

### Front End app exists here:
